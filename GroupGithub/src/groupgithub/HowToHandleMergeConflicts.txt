If a merge conflict occurs it you will most likely be brought to an editor called VI

There are two modes to vi, insert and command
    - it will tell you in the bottom bar
    - to enter inster mode and write something press 'i'
    - to leave enter command mode press Esc

Commands
    - :q will quit
    - :w will save
    - :wq will save + quit

To handle the merge conflict you will most likely need to write some message out then save and quit
If that ^ doesnt work google it lol
